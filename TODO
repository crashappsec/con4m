# This needs to migrate to github issues.

# P0: Before going back to SAMI
- Basic debugging (array indexing is broken)
- string literals still need to be converted to values properly (in treecheck)
- Make sure sections are right in ST layout
- Do all the built-in bits and checking vs. schema
- String interpolations
- Integrate into SAMI
- Build a SAMI config file

# P1: Before going public
- What happens w/ bad indexing?
- Should we only allow assigning to ATTRS once?  At least per-file.
- Cleanup error handling massively, including error messages and what
  context gets oututted.
- Add tuples
- Get all the Nim 2.0 flags on you should have on, including strictdefs, strong
  nil and strictfuncs.

# P2: Later is fine. Add these issues to the repo to track, when time.
- member (.) access, maybe
- Add in <<END as an option for long strings
- Move strings to resources
- Standalone binary to output JSON
- Read in JSON files too
- Hot reloading
- TOML bindings
- What to do w/ null?
- Check dict literals for duplicate entries.  Right now they get squashed.
- Make == and != work on dicts and lists
- Make + and - work for lists and dicts.
- Curses UI for config management
- The ability to add code callbacks
- Flag handling
- Ability to embed and dump configs
