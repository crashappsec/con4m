# This needs to migrate to github issues.

# P0: Need for current sami work
- String interpolations (This is nim-side only).
- Make sure complex types are boxing properly in calls.
- format() call.
- len() call.
- pairs() function.
- Runtime symbol lookup failures (didn't show up in an if statement).


# P2: Later is fine. Add these issues to the repo to track, when time.


- Curses UI for config management
- Ability to embed and dump configs into the actual binary itself.
- Runtime reference before assignment. 

- Error strings should be codes instead.

Use doc strings, command-line arguments.

  ## The doc parameter is for doc strings, which is currently not
  ## used, but will be used down the road when we merge in supporting
  ## command-line argument handling, and start providing help
  ## messages.
