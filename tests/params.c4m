# This will obviously infer `int`, but I eventually want to warn on

# Also, currently, we don't accept the type removal here; we *could*

# a bit.
#
# But I'm not sure that's particularly necessary. Once there is enough
# API, being able to leverage info about the calls made will generally
# be able to help us make correct inferences.
